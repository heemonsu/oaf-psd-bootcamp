The goal of this project is to observe temperature changes in Chicago, Illinois, over the last 80 years.

Steps:
Model builder:
1. Download the hourly measurements from the Open-Metro API site.
2. Create a Chicago_temp.db database and save the temperature data into a table.
3. Save the temperature data into a CSV file and print temperature data to the screen.
Control Data:
4. Calculate the data set's annual min, max, mean, and standard deviation.
5. Calculate the decade min max medium and standard deviation of the data set.
6. Save the calculations to a new table in the database, a CSV file, and print to the screen.
View Data:
6. Plot a line graph of the annual data and the decade data.

The two graphs and a screen capture of the program run are attached.

Observations and Conclusions:
Decade     Max  Mean+Std    Mean  Mean-Std     Min     Std
  1940  35.541    20.813   9.215    -2.383 -27.009  11.598
  1950  36.126    21.429   9.958    -1.513 -26.374  11.471
  1960  36.176    21.195   9.404    -2.387 -28.774  11.791
  1970  35.376    21.292   9.466    -2.360 -26.474  11.826
  1980  36.976    21.546   9.834    -1.878 -31.824  11.712
  1990  37.426    21.302  10.291    -0.720 -32.524  11.011
  2000  36.726    21.645  10.375    -0.895 -28.024  11.270
  2010  36.876    21.541  10.246    -1.049 -32.437  11.295
Over the past 80 years, the data shows that average and maximum temperatures have increased by 1째 Celsius or about 2째 Fahrenheit.
Interestingly, the minimum temperature decreased by 5째 C or about 10째 f.
